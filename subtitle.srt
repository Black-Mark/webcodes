1
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:23,355
The continuous sound from the TV

2
00:00:23,355 --> 00:00:30,000
Piled up laundry - gotta do the wash today

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,917
Make a point of not going out, even if it's sunny

4
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:43,670
Make a toast with unspectacular snacks and alcohol

5
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,353
The two of us, though our sweets and bitters of life

6
00:00:45,353 --> 00:00:47,097
May not mesh

7
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:48,973
As if to lean on each other

8
00:00:48,973 --> 00:00:51,019
Let's shift things a little

9
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:52,748
The sun that you gave to me

10
00:00:52,748 --> 00:00:54,415
So that it remains unhidden by the sun

11
00:00:54,415 --> 00:00:58,098
I sing a melody to sustain the shine

12
00:00:58,098 --> 00:01:01,461
Playful, slowly flowing day

13
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,839
Beyond I love you's

14
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:08,132
We're so alike, and I hope we'll

15
00:01:08,132 --> 00:01:11,564
Continue laughing together until we grow old

16
00:01:11,564 --> 00:01:14,989
Without you, it's a lonely, lonely day

17
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:18,313
In a dream, fall asleep in bed.

18
00:01:18,313 --> 00:01:21,683
I'll wake you up with a morning call

19
00:01:21,683 --> 00:01:26,137
I'll protect you from nightmares, Baby

20
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:45,742
By tracing footsteps that were left behind

21
00:01:46,275 --> 00:01:52,741
I caught you off guard and hugged you from behind

22
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:59,494
I almost forget when it becomes repetitious

23
00:01:59,781 --> 00:02:06,247
But looking back, I realize there was nothing ordinary about those days

24
00:02:06,452 --> 00:02:08,173
The two of us with matching cells

25
00:02:08,173 --> 00:02:09,786
The intertwining of the exceptional

26
00:02:09,786 --> 00:02:13,876
Is what I want to savor in life, I realized in an afternoon of slumber

27
00:02:13,876 --> 00:02:15,419
Sighs, escaping body heat

28
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:17,179
Not wanting to miss a single detail

29
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:20,797
I burn these sweet moments into memory

30
00:02:20,797 --> 00:02:24,206
Playful, slowly flowing day

31
00:02:24,206 --> 00:02:27,646
Beyond I love you's

32
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:31,071
We're so different, but I hope we'll

33
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:34,410
Continue laughing together until we grow old

34
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,726
Without you, it's a lonely, lonely day

35
00:02:37,726 --> 00:02:41,212
In a dream, fall asleep in bed.

36
00:02:41,212 --> 00:02:44,536
I'll wake you up with a morning call

37
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:48,457
I'll protect you from nightmares, Baby

38
00:02:48,457 --> 00:02:52,911
Don't let go of our hands held together

39
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:57,211
Sorry, I guess I just want to be near you

40
00:02:57,211 --> 00:03:00,264
The feelings kept in our hearts are mutual 

41
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:02,032
See, we're even

42
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:06,463
Misunderstandings and mistakes are common

43
00:03:06,463 --> 00:03:12,164
An approach that failed to go as planned, even sadness

44
00:03:12,164 --> 00:03:13,785
Let's split them into two

45
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:15,476
Hoping it's not an ending

46
00:03:15,476 --> 00:03:20,309
Trying to avoid being self-satisfied, avoid

47
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:26,797
Without you, right now, I'd be somewhere

48
00:03:26,797 --> 00:03:30,105
Still unable to move

49
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:33,615
I want to say thank you

50
00:03:33,615 --> 00:03:36,900
From now on, I'll be the one to support you

51
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,224
It's absurd how much

52
00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:43,734
My love grows day by day

53
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:47,182
But when I face you, I just can't

54
00:03:47,182 --> 00:03:51,629
Show you the way I really feel, I'm so sorry

55
00:03:52,055 --> 00:03:55,557
Playful, slowly flowing day

56
00:03:55,557 --> 00:03:58,835
Beyond I love you's

57
00:03:58,835 --> 00:04:02,174
We're so alike, and I hope we'll

58
00:04:02,174 --> 00:04:05,661
Continue laughing together until we grow old

59
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:09,008
Without you, it's a lonely, lonely day

60
00:04:09,008 --> 00:04:12,286
In a dream, fall asleep in bed.

61
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:15,773
I'll wake you up with a morning call

62
00:04:15,773 --> 00:04:20,390
I'll protect you from nightmares, baby
