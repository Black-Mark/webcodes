00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:23.355
The continuous sound from the TV

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:30.000
Piled up laundry - gotta do the wash today

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.917
Make a point of not going out, even if it's sunny

00:00:36.917 --> 00:00:43.670
Make a toast with unspectacular snacks and alcohol

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.353
The two of us, though our sweets and bitters of life

00:00:45.353 --> 00:00:47.097
May not mesh

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:48.973
As if to lean on each other

00:00:48.973 --> 00:00:51.019
Let's shift things a little

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:52.748
The sun that you gave to me

00:00:52.748 --> 00:00:54.415
So that it remains unhidden by the sun

00:00:54.415 --> 00:00:58.098
I sing a melody to sustain the shine

00:00:58.098 --> 00:01:01.461
Playful, slowly flowing day

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:04.839
Beyond I love you's

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.132
We're so alike, and I hope we'll

00:01:08.132 --> 00:01:11.564
Continue laughing together until we grow old

00:01:11.564 --> 00:01:14.989
Without you, it's a lonely, lonely day

00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:18.313
In a dream, fall asleep in bed.

00:01:18.313 --> 00:01:21.683
I'll wake you up with a morning call

00:01:21.683 --> 00:01:26.137
I'll protect you from nightmares, Baby

00:01:39.483 --> 00:01:45.742
By tracing footsteps that were left behind

00:01:46.275 --> 00:01:52.741
I caught you off guard and hugged you from behind

00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:59.494
I almost forget when it becomes repetitious

00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:06.247
But looking back, I realize there was nothing ordinary about those days

00:02:06.452 --> 00:02:08.173
The two of us with matching cells

00:02:08.173 --> 00:02:09.786
The intertwining of the exceptional

00:02:09.786 --> 00:02:13.876
Is what I want to savor in life, I realized in an afternoon of slumber

00:02:13.876 --> 00:02:15.419
Sighs, escaping body heat

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:17.179
Not wanting to miss a single detail

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:20.797
I burn these sweet moments into memory

00:02:20.797 --> 00:02:24.206
Playful, slowly flowing day

00:02:24.206 --> 00:02:27.646
Beyond I love you's

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:31.071
We're so different, but I hope we'll

00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:34.410
Continue laughing together until we grow old

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.726
Without you, it's a lonely, lonely day

00:02:37.726 --> 00:02:41.212
In a dream, fall asleep in bed.

00:02:41.212 --> 00:02:44.536
I'll wake you up with a morning call

00:02:44.536 --> 00:02:48.457
I'll protect you from nightmares, Baby

00:02:48.457 --> 00:02:52.911
Don't let go of our hands held together

00:02:52.911 --> 00:02:57.211
Sorry, I guess I just want to be near you

00:02:57.211 --> 00:03:00.264
The feelings kept in our hearts are mutual

00:03:00.264 --> 00:03:02.032
See, we're even

00:03:02.032 --> 00:03:06.463
Misunderstandings and mistakes are common

00:03:06.463 --> 00:03:12.164
An approach that failed to go as planned, even sadness

00:03:12.164 --> 00:03:13.785
Let's split them into two

00:03:13.785 --> 00:03:15.476
Hoping it's not an ending

00:03:15.476 --> 00:03:20.309
Trying to avoid being self-satisfied, avoid

00:03:23.287 --> 00:03:26.797
Without you, right now, I'd be somewhere

00:03:26.797 --> 00:03:30.105
Still unable to move

00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:33.615
I want to say thank you

00:03:33.615 --> 00:03:36.900
From now on, I'll be the one to support you

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.224
It's absurd how much

00:03:40.224 --> 00:03:43.734
My love grows day by day

00:03:43.734 --> 00:03:47.182
But when I face you, I just can't

00:03:47.182 --> 00:03:51.629
Show you the way I really feel, I'm so sorry

00:03:52.055 --> 00:03:55.557
Playful, slowly flowing day

00:03:55.557 --> 00:03:58.835
Beyond I love you's

00:03:58.835 --> 00:04:02.174
We're so alike, and I hope we'll

00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:05.661
Continue laughing together until we grow old

00:04:05.661 --> 00:04:09.008
Without you, it's a lonely, lonely day

00:04:09.008 --> 00:04:12.286
In a dream, fall asleep in bed.

00:04:12.286 --> 00:04:15.773
I'll wake you up with a morning call

00:04:15.773 --> 00:04:20.390
I'll protect you from nightmares, baby
